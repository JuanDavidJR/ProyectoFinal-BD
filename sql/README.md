## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- PostgreSQL 17.0+
- psql command-line tool
- Git (for version control)

### Database Setup
1. **Create Database:**
   ```bash
   psql -U postgres -f ddl/01-create-database.sql
   ```

2. **Run Full Pipeline:**
   ```bash
   # Execute complete database setup
   ./pipelines/create-database/run-all.sh
   
   # Insert initial data
   ./pipelines/insert-data/run-all.sh
   ```

3. **Test Installation:**
   ```bash
   psql -U postgres -d vibesia_db -f queries/01-complex-query.sql
   ```

## üß™ Development Notes

- All scripts are compatible with **PostgreSQL 17.0+**.
- SQL files are modular, organized by responsibility.
- Most DDL/DML scripts can be run independently or via batch pipelines.
- Audit functionality is triggered automatically on data changes.
- Read `sql/dml/audit/README.md` for full audit tracking system.

### Naming Conventions
- **DDL files:** Numbered sequentially (`01-`, `02-`, etc.)
- **DML data files:** Sequential loading order
- **Functions:** Descriptive names with hyphen separation
- **Stored procedures:** Prefixed with `sp_`

### Best Practices
- Always backup database before running DDL alterations
- Test functions and procedures in development environment first
- Use transactions for batch data operations
- Monitor audit logs for system changes

---

## üéì Educational Objective

This SQL architecture supports the academic goal of building a robust and observable PostgreSQL database system capable of:

- **Normalized Structure:** Proper relational design with foreign keys
- **Modular Organization:** Clear separation of concerns (DDL/DML/Functions)
- **Audit Logging:** Complete change tracking and accountability
- **Backend Integration:** Functions and procedures ready for API consumption
- **Analytics Ready:** Complex queries for insights and reporting
- **Scalable Design:** Pipeline automation for deployment and maintenance

---

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Database Connection Errors:**
```bash
# Check PostgreSQL service status
sudo systemctl status postgresql

# Verify user permissions
psql -U postgres -c "\du"
```

**Script Execution Failures:**
```bash
# Run with verbose output
psql -U postgres -d vibesia_db -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1 -f yourscript.sql
```

**Audit Function Not Triggering:**
- Verify triggers are installed: `\dt` in psql
- Check function permissions and syntax
- Review `dml/audit/README.md` for debugging steps

---

## üìà Performance Considerations

- **Indexing:** Primary keys and foreign keys are automatically indexed
- **Audit Impact:** Audit triggers add ~5-10% overhead to DML operations
- **Query Optimization:** Use `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` for complex queries
- **Connection Pooling:** Recommended for production deployments
